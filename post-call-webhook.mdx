		- `dial_no_answer` - No one answered the call - `dial_busy` - Line was
		busy - `network_error` - Network connectivity issues
	</Card>
</CardGroup>

<CardGroup cols={2}>

## Transcript Format

### Structure

Transcripts are arrays of conversation turns, where each turn is a two-element array:

```json
["speaker", "message"]
```

### Speaker Types

| Speaker       | Description                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `"assistant"` | AI agent responses               |
| `"user"`      | Human caller input               |
| `"system"`    | System messages or notifications |

### Example Transcript Analysis

```json
{
	"transcript": [
		[
			"assistant",
			"Hello, this is Sarah from Openmic. How can I help you today?"
		],
		["user", "Hi, I need to check my account balance"],
		[
			"assistant",
			"I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me look up your account information."
		],
		[
			"assistant",
			"I can see your current balance is $1,250.50. Is there anything else I can help you with?"
		],
		["user", "That's perfect, thank you!"],
		["assistant", "You're welcome! Have a great day!"]
	]
}
```

<Note>
	**Empty Transcripts**: Failed calls or very short calls may have empty
	transcript arrays. Always check if the transcript exists and has content
	before processing.
</Note>

## Success Determination

### Understanding `isSuccessful`

The `isSuccessful` field indicates whether the call achieved its intended business objective, not just technical success:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
	<Card title="Successful Calls" icon="check-circle" iconType="solid">
		**`isSuccessful: true`** - Appointment successfully booked - Customer
		inquiry fully resolved - Sales lead qualified and interested - Support
		issue resolved
	</Card>

	<Card title="Unsuccessful Calls" icon="x-circle" iconType="solid">
		**`isSuccessful: false`** - Customer declined offer - Unable to resolve
		issue - Incorrect number/wrong person - Call ended prematurely
	</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
	**Connected â‰  Successful**: A call can connect and have a full conversation
	but still be marked as unsuccessful if it didn't achieve its goal.
</Warning>
