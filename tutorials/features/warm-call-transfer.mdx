## What is a Warm Transfer?

With a **warm transfer**, your AI agent privately tells your team member about the call before connecting them to the customer.

**Example:**
- Customer tells the AI their issue
- AI calls your team and privately says: "Customer needs help with billing. They sound frustrated."
- Team member is ready and prepared
- AI connects everyone together
- No need for the customer to repeat themselves!
