    ### Step 1: Get Your Cal.com Details

    Before you start, you'll need a Cal.com account.

    **What you'll need:**
    - Your Cal.com **username** (e.g., if your link is `cal.com/john`, your username is `john`)
      - Find it at [your Cal.com profile page](https://app.cal.com/settings/my-account/profile)
    - Or your **organization slug** (e.g., if your team URL is `acme.cal.com`, it's `acme`)

<Tip>
  Don't have Cal.com yet? Sign up for free at [cal.com](https://cal.com)
</Tip>

<Note>
  **First time using Cal.com?** Make sure you've created at least one event type in your calendar. Go to [Event Types](https://app.cal.com/event-types) and create one (like "30 Minute Meeting") before continuing.

    ---

    ### Step 5: Choose Static Mode (Easy Setup)

    1. Select **Static Mode** (no API key needed!)
    2. Enter your Cal.com username or organization slug
    3. Click **Fetch Event Types**

    ---

    ### Step 6: Select Your Event Type

    You'll see a dropdown with your calendar types (like "30 Min Meeting", "Consultation", etc.)

    **Choose the event type** you want to book.

    **What's an event type?**  
    It's the type of appointment in your Cal.com calendar - like a 30-minute call, 1-hour consultation, etc.

    Click **Next** to continue.

    ---

    ### Step 7: Configure the Function

    Fill in these fields:

    **Function Name:** `book_appointment`  
    (Use underscores, no spaces)

    **Description:** `Use this when the customer wants to book an appointment`

    **Timezone (optional):** Your timezone like `America/New_York`

    ---

    ### Step 8: Save the Function

    Click **Create Function** at the bottom.

    ---

    ### Step 9: Update Your Agent Prompt

    Tell your AI when to use the booking function:

    1. Go to the **Configuration** tab
    2. Add this to your agent's prompt:

    ```
    When a customer confirms they want to book an appointment and provides 
    their preferred time, use the book_appointment function. Make sure to 
    collect their name and email address first.
    ```

    ---

    ### Step 10: Test It!

    1. Call your AI agent
    2. Say: "I'd like to book an appointment for Tuesday at 2 PM"
    3. AI will ask for your name and email
    4. AI creates the booking
    5. You get a confirmation email!

**Example conversation:**
```
Customer: "I'd like to book for Tuesday at 2 PM"
AI: "Perfect! May I have your name and email?"
Customer: "John Smith, john@example.com"
AI: "Great! I've booked your appointment for Tuesday at 2:00 PM. 
You'll receive a confirmation email shortly!"
```

<Tip>
  Use your own email first to see how the booking confirmation works!
</Tip>

    ---

    ### 💡 Pro Tip

<Tip>
  **Combine with Calendar Check**: Add the **Check Calendar Availability** function to your agent too! This way, when customers ask "When are you available?", your AI can show them open time slots. Then once they pick a time, it uses the booking function to confirm it. This gives a much better experience and avoids double-booking.

    After configuring the node:

    1. Drag a line from another node to connect it to your booking node
    2. Click on the connection line between the nodes
    3. Set the **transition condition** - this tells your workflow when to move to the booking step

    "When the customer confirms they want to book an appointment"

    ### Step 7: Save Your Workflow

    Click **Save** in the top right corner.

    ### Step 8: Test It!

    2. When the workflow reaches the booking step, it will automatically:

       - Book the appointment
       - Send confirmation email

**Example conversation:**
```
Customer: "I'd like to book for Tuesday at 2 PM"
AI: "Perfect! May I have your name and email?"
Customer: "John Smith, john@example.com"
AI: "Great! I've booked your appointment for Tuesday at 2:00 PM. 
You'll receive a confirmation email shortly!"
