Running AI-powered outbound calling campaigns has never been easier. With OpenMic, you can create a voice agent, upload your contacts, and run personalized campaigns in just a few steps. In this guide, we'll walk through the entire process — from signup to monitoring call logs.

## 1. Sign Up for OpenMic

Head over to OpenMic and create your account. Once you're signed in, you'll have access to the **dashboard**, where you can create and manage your agents and campaigns.

## 2. Create a New Agent

- Go to the **Agents** section and click **Create New Agent**.
- Fill in the **agent settings** (such as name, voice, and any other configurations).

<Tip>
When writing the **Agent Script**, you can use **dynamic variables** like:
- `{{name}}`
- `{{address}}`
- `{{Account Id}}`

These placeholders will automatically pull values from your uploaded contact list. Just make sure your CSV file has **headers that match these variable names** (case sensitive).
</Tip>

## 3. Upload Your Contact List

1. Prepare your sheet like this and export it as CSV.

4. Upload your CSV file.

5. **Map the fields**:
   - Ensure **Name** and **Phone Number** are correctly mapped.
   - Any additional headers (like address or Account Id) will automatically align with the variables in your script.

## 5. Create a Campaign

Now that your agent and contact list are ready:

1. Go to the **Campaigns** section.
2. Click **Create New Campaign**.

</Frame>

3. Select:
   - The **Agent** you just created.
   - The **Contact List** you uploaded.
   - The **Phone Number** from which calls will originate.

4. Choose your campaign schedule type:
   - **Single Run**: Schedule a one-time campaign for a specific date and time.
   - **Multi Run**: Set up a recurring campaign that runs on multiple days of the week.

### Multi Run Campaign

For campaigns that need to run on multiple days (e.g., Monday through Friday), use the **Multi Run** option:

1. Click on the **Multi Run** tab in the campaign creation form.
2. Enter a **Scheduler Name** to identify your recurring campaign.
3. **Select the days of the week** when the campaign should be active (e.g., Monday through Friday).
4. Set the **Start Time** and **End Time** for each day (e.g., 08:30 to 17:00).
5. Select the appropriate **Timezone** for your campaign.

  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
**Multi Run campaigns** are perfect for business hours calling, allowing you to automatically run campaigns on weekdays during specific time windows. The campaign will automatically start and stop based on your configured schedule.
</Tip>


## 6. Run & Monitor Your Campaign

- At the scheduled time, your campaign will begin dialing contacts **in order** from the list.

- Your agent will dynamically insert values from your CSV (e.g., "Hello `{{name}}`, we're calling about your account `{{Account Id}}`").

- You can track performance and outcomes in the **Call Logs** section, where each interaction is recorded.

- You can also reschedule the campaign, just click on the campaign and change the date and time.
