## Configure Background Sound

Follow these steps to add and customize background sounds for your AI voice agent:

### Step 1: Navigate to Simple Agents

Start by accessing the agent management section:

1. Log in to your [OpenMic Dashboard](https://chat.openmic.ai/login)
2. Navigate to the **Simple Agents** section from the sidebar

<Note>
  This is where you'll manage all settings for your voice agents, including
  personality, voice, and room settings.
</Note>

---

### Step 2: Select Your Agent

Choose the agent you want to customize:

1. From the list of agents, click on the agent you want to configure
2. This will open the agent's settings page

<Tip>
  If you don't have an agent yet, create one first by clicking the **Create
  Agent** button.
</Tip>

---

### Step 3: Open Voice & Personality Tab

Access the voice and personality settings:

1. In the agent settings, navigate to the **Voice & Personality** tab
2. Scroll down to locate the **Background Sound** section

<Note>
  The Voice & Personality tab contains all audio-related settings for your
  agent, including voice selection, personality traits, and background ambience.
</Note>

---

### Step 4: Choose Background Sound Type

Select the ambience that best fits your use case:

1. Under **Background Sound**, click on the **Sound Type** dropdown menu
2. Preview the available ambience options:
   - **None** - No background sound (default)
   - **Coffee Shop Ambience** - Casual, relaxed atmosphere
   - **Office Environment** - Professional setting
   - **Call Center** - Busy customer service environment
   - **And more...**
3. Select your preferred background sound

<Tip>
  You can preview each sound option before making your selection to find the
  perfect match for your brand and use case.
</Tip>

### Step 5: Adjust Volume Level

Fine-tune the background sound volume:

1. Use the **Volume** slider to adjust the background sound level
2. Start with a lower value (e.g., 0.15 - 0.25) to ensure the agent's voice remains prominent
3. Adjust incrementally until you achieve the perfect balance

<Warning>
  **Keep the agent's voice clear**: Set the background volume low enough that it
  doesn't interfere with the agent's speech. The background sound should enhance
  the experience, not overpower the conversation.
</Warning>

---

### Step 6: Test Your Configuration

Before deploying, test your background sound settings:

1. Click the **Test Call** button in the top right corner of the agent settings
2. Click **Start Test Call** to initiate a test conversation
3. Interact with the agent to hear how the background sound works during an actual call
4. Listen for:
   - **Clarity** - Can you hear the agent clearly?
   - **Balance** - Is the background sound at an appropriate level?
   - **Atmosphere** - Does it create the desired ambience?

<Tip>
  Test multiple times with different volume levels to find the optimal setting
  for your use case.
</Tip>

5. Close the test call window once you're satisfied with the configuration
