    alt="Voicemail Detection Configuration"
  />
</Frame>

### Action

Choose what happens when voicemail is detected:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Hang up if reaching voicemail">
    The agent will immediately end the call when voicemail is detected without leaving a message.
    
    **Best for:**
    - When you only want to reach live contacts
    - Compliance requirements that restrict automated voicemail messages
    - High-volume calling campaigns
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Leave a message if reaching voicemail">
    The agent will deliver a custom voicemail message when voicemail is detected.
    
    **Best for:**
    - Ensuring your communication reaches the recipient
    - Appointment reminders and follow-ups
    - Customer service callbacks
    - Sales and lead nurturing
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

---

### Voicemail Message

If you selected "Leave a message if reaching voicemail", configure your message:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Prompt">
    Use dynamic, AI-generated messages based on the conversation context and agent's prompt instructions.
    
    **How it works:**
    - The AI composes the voicemail message on the fly
    - Can adapt based on conversation history
    - More natural and contextual
    
    **Example use case:** "Generate a voicemail explaining why I called based on the customer's recent support ticket."
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Static Sentence">
    Use a fixed, pre-written message that will be delivered every time.
    
    **How it works:**
    - Type your exact message in the text field
    - The same message is used for every voicemail
    - Consistent and predictable
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    Hey, sorry we could not reach you directly. Please give us a callback if you can.
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  Keep voicemail messages brief (20-30 seconds) and include a clear call-to-action with your callback number or next steps.
</Tip>

### Save Configuration

Click **Save** to apply your voicemail detection configuration.

<Note>
  For workflows, remember to also click **Save** on the workflow editor after configuring voicemail detection.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
