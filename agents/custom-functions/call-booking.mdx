## Overview

The Call Booking function integrates your Cal.com calendars with your AI agents, enabling them to book appointments automatically during conversations. This powerful feature completes the scheduling process by not just checking availability, but actually creating confirmed bookings.

**Key Benefits:**
- Book appointments automatically during conversations
- Eliminate back-and-forth scheduling coordination

    ## Configuration Modes for Simple Agents

    Cal.com offers two ways to connect your calendar: **Static Mode** (no API key required) and **Webhook Mode** (requires API key for more control). Choose the mode that best fits your needs.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Static Mode">
        ## Static Mode Configuration
        
        Static mode fetches publicly available event types using your Cal.com username or organization slug. This is the easiest way to get started and doesn't require an API key.
        
        ### Step 1: Enter Cal.com Username or Organization Slug
        
        <Frame>
          <img
            src="/images/agents/custom-functions/call-booking/simple/static/step-1.png"
            alt="Enter Username or Organization Slug"
            style={{ height: "400px" }}
          />
        </Frame>
        
        Enter your Cal.com **username** or **organization slug**:
        
        - **Username**: Your personal Cal.com username (e.g., `jane` if your Cal.com URL is `cal.com/jane`)
          - Find it in your Cal.com profile settings
        - **Organization Slug**: Your organization's Cal.com slug (e.g., `acme` if your team URLs are like `acme.cal.com/jane` or `schedule.acme.com/jane`)
          - Find it in your organization settings
        
        ---
        
        ### Step 2: Fetch Event Types

        <Frame>
            <img
                src="/images/agents/custom-functions/call-booking/simple/static/step-2.png"
                alt="Fetch Event Types"
                style={{ height: "400px" }}
            />
        </Frame>
        
        Click the **Fetch Event Types** button to retrieve all publicly available event types from your Cal.com account.
        
        After fetching, you'll see a dropdown list of all your available event types (e.g., "30 Minute Meeting", "Discovery Call", "Consultation").
        
        **Choose an Event Type** from the dropdown that you want your AI agent to book appointments for.
        
        Click **Next** to continue.
        
        ---
        
        ### Step 3: Configure Function Options
        
        <Frame>
          <img
            src="/images/agents/custom-functions/call-booking/simple/static/step-3.png"
            alt="Configure Function Options"
            style={{ height: "400px" }}
          />
        </Frame>
        
        Configure the following options:
        
        #### Function Name
        Give your function a descriptive name in snake_case (e.g., `book_consultation`, `schedule_meeting`, `book_appointment`).
        
        #### Description
        Describe when this function should be used. This helps the AI understand when to book appointments.
        
        **Examples:**
        - "Use this when the customer wants to book a consultation appointment"
        - "Book this when the customer confirms they want to schedule a meeting"
        - "Use this to create an appointment booking in the calendar"
        
        #### Timezone (Optional)
        Specify the timezone for booking appointments (e.g., `America/New_York` or `Europe/London`). If not provided, Cal.com will use its default timezone (UTC).
        
        ---
        
        ### Step 4: Create Function
        
        Click **Create Function** to save your configuration. The function is now ready to use!
        
        ---
        
        ### Step 5: Test the Function
        
        Test your newly created function:
        
        1. Start a call or conversation with your AI agent
        2. Ask your agent to book an appointment, for example:
           - "I'd like to book an appointment for Tuesday at 2 PM"
           - "Can you schedule me for next Monday at 10 AM?"
           - "Book me for the 3 PM slot on Thursday"
        
        Your agent will use the function to create a booking in your Cal.com calendar and confirm the appointment with the customer.
        
        <Note>
          **Static mode uses public event types**, so ensure the event type you selected is set to "Public" in your Cal.com settings.
        </Note>
        
      </Tab>
      
      <Tab title="Webhook Mode">
        ## Webhook Mode Configuration
        
        Webhook mode provides more control and security by using your Cal.com API key. This allows you to access private event types and configure advanced settings.
        
        ### Step 1: Enter Cal.com API Key and Event Type ID
        
        <Frame>
          <img
            src="/images/agents/custom-functions/call-booking/simple/webhook/step-1.png"
            alt="Enter API Key and Event Type ID"
            style={{ height: "400px" }}
          />
        </Frame>
        
        You'll need two pieces of information from your Cal.com account:
        
        #### Cal.com API Key
        
        Generate an API key from your Cal.com account:
        
        1. Log in to [Cal.com](https://app.cal.com)
        2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Security** → **API Keys**
        3. Click **New API Key**
        4. Give it a name (e.g., "OpenMic Integration")
        5. Copy the generated API key
        6. Paste it in the **API Key** field
        
        <Warning>
          **Keep your API key secure**: Never share your API key publicly. It provides access to your Cal.com account and calendar data.
        </Warning>
        
        #### Cal.com Event Type ID
        
        Find your Event Type ID:
        
        1. Go to your Cal.com dashboard
        2. Click on **Event Types**
        3. Open the event type you want to use
        4. Look at the URL in your browser's address bar
        5. The Event Type ID is the number between the slashes
           - Example: `app.cal.com/event-types/123456` → Event Type ID is `123456`
        
        For more details, see [Cal.com's guide on finding Event Type IDs](https://cal.com/help/event-types/eventtype-id).
        
        #### Configure Additional Fields
        
        <Frame>
          <img
            src="/images/agents/custom-functions/call-booking/simple/webhook/step-1+.png"
            alt="Configure Additional Fields"
            style={{ height: "400px" }}
          />
        </Frame>
        
        After entering your API key and Event Type ID, you'll see additional webhook configuration options:
        
        **Call a webhook before running this tool** (Optional)
        - Toggle this on to validate or enrich data before booking appointments
        - **Use the pre-call webhook URL**: Use the webhook URL configured in your agent settings
        - **Custom webhook URL**: Or provide a custom webhook URL for this specific function (e.g., `https://your-domain.com/webhook/pre-tool`)
        
        Click **Next** to proceed to the function configuration.
        
        ---
        
        ### Step 2: Configure Function Options

            style={{ height: "400px" }}
          />
        </Frame>
        
        Configure the following options:
        
        #### Function Name
        Give your function a descriptive name in snake_case (e.g., `book_private_meeting`, `schedule_team_call`, `book_consultation`).
        
        #### Description
        Describe when this function should be used. This helps the AI understand when to book appointments.
        
        **Examples:**
        - "Use this when the customer confirms they want to book a consultation"
        - "Book this when someone wants to schedule a private meeting"
        - "Use this to create confirmed appointment bookings"
        
        ---
        
        ### Step 3: Create Function
        
        Click **Create Function** to save your configuration. The function is now ready to use!
        
        ---
        
        ### Step 4: Test the Function
        
        Test your newly created function:
        
        1. Start a call or conversation with your AI agent
        2. Ask your agent to book an appointment, for example:
           - "I'd like to book an appointment for Tuesday at 2 PM"
           - "Can you schedule me for next Monday at 10 AM?"
           - "Book me for the 3 PM slot on Thursday"
        
        Your agent will use the function to create a booking in your Cal.com calendar and confirm the appointment with the customer.
        
        <Note>
          **Webhook mode works with both public and private event types**, giving you more flexibility in your scheduling setup.
        </Note>
        
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    ## Agent Prompt Example

    To help your AI agent use the booking function effectively, add clear instructions to your agent's system prompt:

    ```
    When customers want to book an appointment and have chosen a specific time slot, 
    use the book_appointment function to create the booking in the calendar.

    Always confirm the following details before booking:
    - Preferred date and time
    - Customer's name
    - Customer's email address
    - Any special requirements or notes

    After successfully booking, provide the customer with:
    - Confirmation of the booked date and time
    - Timezone information
    - Any preparation instructions or next steps

    Example conversation flow:
    
    Customer: "I'd like to book the Tuesday 2 PM slot"
    Agent: "Perfect! Let me book that for you on Tuesday at 2 PM. May I have your 
    name and email address to confirm the appointment?"
    
    Customer: "It's John Smith, john@example.com"
    Agent: [Uses booking function] "Great! I've confirmed your appointment for 
    Tuesday, March 14th at 2:00 PM Eastern Time. You'll receive a confirmation 
    email at john@example.com with all the details."
    ```

## Pro Tip: Combine with Check Calendar Availability

<Tip>
  **Best Practice**: For the best user experience, combine the Call Booking function with the [Check Calendar Availability](/agents/custom-functions/check-calendar-availability) function. 
  
  This allows your agent to:
  1. First check available time slots when customers ask "When are you available?"
  2. Then book the appointment once the customer chooses a preferred time
  
  This two-step approach reduces booking conflicts and provides a smoother scheduling experience.
</Tip>

## Frequently Asked Questions

    1. Go to Cal.com and open your Event Types
    2. Click on the event type you want to use
