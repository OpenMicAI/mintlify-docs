</Frame>

---

### Step 6: Configure the Function

Fill in the required fields:

#### Function Name
Give your function a descriptive name (e.g., "Send Appointment Confirmation", "Send Link", "Send Verification Code").

#### Description
Describe when this function should be used. This helps the AI understand when to trigger the SMS.

**Examples:**
- "Use this when the customer requests an appointment confirmation via text"
- "Send this when the customer asks for the link to our website"
- "Use this when the customer needs their verification code"

#### SMS Message

Choose how the message should be generated:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Prompt">
    Use AI-generated messages based on the conversation context.
    
    **How it works:**
    - The AI composes the SMS dynamically based on the conversation
    - Can adapt based on customer information and context
    - More flexible and contextual
    
    **Example:** "Generate an SMS with the appointment details discussed in this conversation."
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Static">
    Use a fixed, pre-written message that will be sent every time.
    
    **How it works:**
    - Type your exact message in the text field
    - The same message is used every time this function is triggered
    - Consistent and predictable
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    Thank you for calling! Here's the link to our website: https://example.com
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

---

### Step 7: Save the Function

Click **Save** to add the Send SMS function to your agent.

<Note>
  Once saved, your AI agent will be able to use this function during conversations when the conditions you described are met.
</Note>

</Frame>

Fill in the required fields:

#### Function Name
Give your SMS step a descriptive name (e.g., "Send Welcome SMS", "Send Confirmation", "Send Follow-up").

#### SMS Message

Choose how the message should be generated:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Prompt">
    Use AI-generated messages based on the workflow context and variables.
    
    **How it works:**
    - The AI composes the SMS dynamically
    - Can incorporate workflow variables and context
    - More flexible and personalized
    
    **Example:** "Send an SMS with the appointment details including the date, time, and location from the workflow variables."
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Static">
    Use a fixed, pre-written message.
    
    **How it works:**
    - Type your exact message in the text field
    - The same message is sent every time this node executes
    - Consistent and predictable
    
    **Example:**

    Your appointment has been confirmed. We look forward to seeing you!
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I know if the SMS was sent successfully?">
    You can check your call logs and workflow execution history to see if the SMS function was triggered and whether it was sent successfully. Delivery status will be indicated in the logs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if the customer's phone number is invalid?">
    The system will log an error, and the SMS will not be sent. You can review failed attempts in your call logs and analytics.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I send SMS to multiple numbers?">
