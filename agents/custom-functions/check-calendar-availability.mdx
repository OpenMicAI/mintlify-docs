## Configuration Modes

Cal.com offers two ways to connect your calendar: **Static Mode** (no API key required) and **Webhook Mode** (requires API key for more control). Choose the mode that best fits your needs.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Static Mode">
    ## Static Mode Configuration
    
    Static mode fetches publicly available event types using your Cal.com username or organization slug. This is the easiest way to get started and doesn't require an API key.
    
    ### Step 1: Enter Cal.com Username or Organization Slug
    
    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/agents/custom-functions/check-calendar-availability/static/step-1.png"
        alt="Enter Username or Organization Slug"
        style={{ height: "400px" }}
      />
    </Frame>
    
    Enter your Cal.com **username** or **organization slug**:
    
    - **Username**: Your personal Cal.com username (e.g., `jane` if your Cal.com URL is `cal.com/jane`)
      - Find it in your Cal.com profile settings
    - **Organization Slug**: Your organization's Cal.com slug (e.g., `acme` if your team URLs are like `acme.cal.com/jane` or `schedule.acme.com/jane`)
      - Find it in your organization settings
    
    ---
    
    ### Step 2: Fetch Event Types
    
    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/agents/custom-functions/check-calendar-availability/static/step-2.png"
        alt="Fetch Event Types"
        style={{ height: "400px" }}
      />
    </Frame>
    
    Click the **Fetch Event Types** button to retrieve all publicly available event types from your Cal.com account.
    
    After fetching, you'll see a dropdown list of all your available event types (e.g., "30 Minute Meeting", "Discovery Call", "Consultation").
    
    **Choose an Event Type** from the dropdown that you want your AI agent to check availability for.
    
    ---
    
    ### Step 3: Configure Function Options
    
    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/agents/custom-functions/check-calendar-availability/static/step-3.png"
        alt="Configure Function Options"
        style={{ height: "400px" }}
      />
    </Frame>
    
    Configure the following options:
    
    #### Function Name
    Give your function a descriptive name in snake_case (e.g., `check_30min_meeting_availability`, `check_consultation_slots`).
    
    #### Description
    Describe when this function should be used. This helps the AI understand when to check availability.
    
    **Examples:**
    - "Use this when the customer asks about available time slots for a consultation"
    - "Check this when the customer wants to know when I'm free for a meeting"
    - "Use this to find available appointment times"
    
    #### Timezone (Optional)
    Specify the timezone for checking availability (e.g., `America/New_York` or `Europe/London`). If not provided, Cal.com will use its default timezone (UTC).
    
    ---
    
    ### Step 4: Create Function
    
    Click **Create Function** to save your configuration. The function is now ready to use!
    
    ---
    
    ### Step 5: Test the Function
    
    Test your newly created function:
    
    1. Start a call or conversation with your AI agent
    2. Ask your agent to check for available slots, for example:
       - "What times are available this week?"
       - "When is the next available appointment?"
       - "Show me available slots for next Monday"
    
    Your agent will use the function to fetch real-time availability from your Cal.com calendar and respond with open time slots.
    
    <Note>
      **Static mode uses public event types**, so ensure the event type you selected is set to "Public" in your Cal.com settings.
    </Note>
    
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Webhook Mode">
    ## Webhook Mode Configuration
    
    Webhook mode provides more control and security by using your Cal.com API key. This allows you to access private event types and configure advanced settings.
    
    ### Step 1: Enter Cal.com API Key and Event Type ID
    
    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/agents/custom-functions/check-calendar-availability/webhook/step-1.png"
        alt="Enter API Key and Event Type ID"
        style={{ height: "400px" }}
      />
    </Frame>
    
    You'll need two pieces of information from your Cal.com account:
    
    #### Cal.com API Key
    
    Generate an API key from your Cal.com account:
    
    1. Log in to [Cal.com](https://app.cal.com)
    2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Security** → **API Keys**
    3. Click **New API Key**
    4. Give it a name (e.g., "OpenMic Integration")
    5. Copy the generated API key
    6. Paste it in the **API Key** field
    
    <Warning>
      **Keep your API key secure**: Never share your API key publicly. It provides access to your Cal.com account and calendar data.
    </Warning>
    
    #### Cal.com Event Type ID
    
    Find your Event Type ID:
    
    1. Go to your Cal.com dashboard
    2. Click on **Event Types**
    3. Open the event type you want to use
    4. Look at the URL in your browser's address bar
    5. The Event Type ID is the number between the slashes
       - Example: `app.cal.com/event-types/123456` → Event Type ID is `123456`
    
    For more details, see [Cal.com's guide on finding Event Type IDs](https://cal.com/help/event-types/eventtype-id).
    
    #### Configure Additional Fields
    
    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/agents/custom-functions/check-calendar-availability/webhook/step-1+.png"
        alt="Configure Additional Fields"
        style={{ height: "400px" }}
      />
    </Frame>
    
    After entering your API key and Event Type ID, you'll see additional webhook configuration options:
    
    **Call a webhook before running this tool** (Optional)
    - Toggle this on to validate or enrich data before checking availability
    - **Use the pre-call webhook URL**: Use the webhook URL configured in your agent settings
    - **Custom webhook URL**: Or provide a custom webhook URL for this specific function (e.g., `https://your-domain.com/webhook/pre-tool`)
    
    Click **Next** to proceed to the function configuration.
    
    ---
    
    ### Step 2: Configure Function Options
    
    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/agents/custom-functions/check-calendar-availability/webhook/step-2.png"
        alt="Configure Function Options"
        style={{ height: "400px" }}
      />
    </Frame>
    
    Configure the following options:
    
    #### Function Name
    Give your function a descriptive name in snake_case (e.g., `check_private_calendar_availability`, `check_team_meeting_slots`).
    
    #### Description
    Describe when this function should be used. This helps the AI understand when to check availability.
    
    **Examples:**
    - "Use this when the customer asks about available consultation times"
    - "Check this when someone wants to schedule a private meeting"
    - "Use this to find available slots for team calls"
    
    ---
    
    ### Step 3: Create Function
    
    Click **Create Function** to save your configuration. The function is now ready to use!
    
    ---
    
    ### Step 4: Test the Function
    
    Test your newly created function:
    
    1. Start a call or conversation with your AI agent
    2. Ask your agent to check for available slots, for example:
       - "What times are available this week?"
       - "When is the next available appointment?"
       - "Show me available slots for next Monday"
    
    Your agent will use the function to fetch real-time availability from your Cal.com calendar and respond with open time slots.
    
    <Note>
      **Webhook mode works with both public and private event types**, giving you more flexibility in your scheduling setup.
    </Note>
    
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Update Your Agent Prompt

To help your AI agent use the calendar check function effectively, add instructions to your bot's system prompt:

```
When customers ask about availability, available time slots, or when they can schedule 
an appointment, use the check_calendar_availability function to fetch real-time 
available slots from the calendar.

Present the available times in a clear, conversational way and help the customer 
choose a time that works for them.

Example responses:
- "Let me check my calendar for you. I have availability on Tuesday at 2 PM, 
  Wednesday at 10 AM, and Thursday at 3 PM. Which works best for you?"
- "I see several open slots this week. Would you prefer morning or afternoon?"
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Static and Webhook mode?">
    **Static mode** fetches publicly available event types using your username/organization slug and requires no API key. **Webhook mode** uses your Cal.com API key for access to private event types and more advanced configuration options.

    1. Go to Cal.com and open your Event Types
    2. Click on the event type you want to use

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if there's no availability?">
    Your AI agent will receive the information that no slots are available and can communicate this to the customer. Make sure to train your agent prompt to handle this scenario gracefully (e.g., "I don't have any availability this week, but I have several openings next week. Would you like me to check those?").
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I edit the function after creating it?">
    Yes, you can edit the function configuration at any time. Go to the Custom Functions tab in your agent settings and edit the function as needed.
