description: "Build Natural Sounding Voice AI Agents in Minutes with Openmic.ai"
---



OpenMic is the Voice AI platform for developers.
Integrating LLM models with voice technology to achieve human-sounding speech is challenging. Real-time conversations are unique because they can have two or more participants who pause, question, interject or speak over each other.
OpenMic empowers developers to build for use-cases which require ultra-low latency like  AI receptionists, AI sales, AI therapist, and beyond.
