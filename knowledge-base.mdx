## Overview

Knowledge Base allows you to provide your AI agent with access to a collection of information sources that it can reference during conversations. This feature significantly improves response quality by giving your agent the context it needs to answer questions accurately, especially for use cases like customer support, helpdesk, FAQs, and product information.

<Info>
  When a knowledge base is linked to your agent, it automatically retrieves
  relevant information during conversations without requiring any prompt
  modifications.
</Info>

## Supported Sources

Your knowledge base supports four types of content sources:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Upload File (PDF)" icon="file-pdf">
    Upload PDF documents up to 5MB
  </Card>
  <Card title="Add FAQ" icon="messages-question">
    Create FAQ flashcards with questions and answers
  </Card>
  <Card title="Add Text" icon="text">
    Add custom text snippets and information
  </Card>
  <Card title="Add Web Pages" icon="globe">
    Import content from website URLs
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

When you link a knowledge base to your agent:

1. **Automatic Processing**: Content is chunked, embedded, and stored in a vector database
2. **Contextual Retrieval**: During conversations, the agent searches for relevant information using the conversation transcript
3. **Seamless Integration**: Retrieved information is automatically provided to the AI without manual intervention
4. **Real-Time Access**: Information is fetched and used in real-time during each response generation

<Note>
  The knowledge base uses the conversation transcript (not the prompt) to find
  the most relevant chunks of information.
</Note>

    customers would ask them
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Format Text Content">
    - Use Markdown formatting for better structure - Write short paragraphs
    focusing on single concepts - Include specific details and avoid vague
    references - Use descriptive headings to separate topics - Make information
    self-contained (avoid references to missing context)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Select Quality Web Pages">
    - Choose pages with clear, well-structured content - Ensure URLs are
    publicly accessible and stable - Prefer pages with good formatting over
    walls of text - Verify content is accurate and up-to-date - Select pages
    that are directly relevant to your use case
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips for Better Performance

<Tip>
  **Use Knowledge Base for information, not instructions.** Put operational
  instructions and agent behavior guidelines in your agent's prompt. Use the
  knowledge base to supply supporting facts, data, and reference information.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  **Stay within file size limits.** Each PDF must be under 5MB. If you have
  larger documents, consider: - Splitting them into smaller, topic-focused files
  - Compressing the PDF file - Converting to text format instead
</Warning>

### Improving Response Accuracy

To ensure your agent only uses information from the knowledge base, add this to your agent's prompt:

```text
Only answer using the information from the knowledge base.
If the knowledge base does not contain relevant information to answer the question,
politely respond: "I don't have that information in my knowledge base right now."
```

### When to Use Each Source Type

| Source Type   | Use When                    | Example                                               |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **PDF**       | You have existing documents | Product manuals, policy PDFs, reports                 |
| **FAQ**       | You know common questions   | "What are your hours?", "How do I reset my password?" |
| **Text**      | You need custom snippets    | Company policies, pricing info, quick facts           |
| **Web Pages** | Content is already online   | Help center, blog posts, product pages                |

## Managing Your Knowledge Base

### Updating Content

- **PDFs**: Upload a new version and remove the old one
- **FAQs**: Edit existing flashcards or add new ones
- **Text**: Edit text snippets directly
- **Web Pages**: Re-search and add updated URLs (content is refreshed from source)

### Organizing Multiple Knowledge Bases

You can create multiple knowledge bases and link them to different agents:

- **By Topic**: Separate knowledge bases for billing, technical support, sales
- **By Product**: Different knowledge bases for each product line
- **By Use Case**: Customer service, internal support, sales inquiries

<Info>
  An agent can be connected to multiple knowledge bases simultaneously.
